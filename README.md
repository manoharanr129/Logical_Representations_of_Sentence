# Logical Representations of Sentences

This project explores the **logical representation of sentences**, utilizing machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The primary goal is to create structured representations of linguistic data to enable deeper reasoning and understanding of text.

## Features
- Preprocessing and encoding of natural language text.
- Logical representation construction using symbolic or vector-based methods.
- Evaluation of models using standard NLP metrics.
- Jupyter Notebook implementation for modular and interactive experimentation.

## Installation

To set up the environment and install the required dependencies, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_name>
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. (Optional) Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Logical_Representations_of_Sentence.ipynb
   ```

2. Follow the steps in the notebook to preprocess data, train models, and evaluate results.

3. Modify parameters or add your data to experiment with different configurations.
